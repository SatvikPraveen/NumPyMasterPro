## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

> Most learners stop at tutorials. This repository takes you further — by combining theory, implementation, real-world use cases, and production practices in one place.

✅ Covers **100% of NumPy's essential concepts**  
✅ Demonstrates **clean project structure and modular code reuse**  
✅ Includes **interview-ready topics** like broadcasting, vectorization, and matrix algebra  
✅ Provides **Jupyter notebooks + Python utility scripts + cheat sheet**  
✅ Ends with a **K-Means algorithm from scratch with Elbow Method** — great for resumes

## 🎛️ Streamlit Frontend (Interactive Demo)

You can try the K-Means algorithm with different datasets or number of clusters using:

```bash
streamlit run kmeans_app.py
```

This allows you to upload `.csv` files, set cluster count, and visualize results in real time.
Great for experiments, education, and showcasing clustering interactively.

---

## 🐳 Docker-Based Setup (Optional)

Prefer running in a **containerized Jupyter Lab** environment?

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open the browser at:
👉 [http://localhost:8889](http://localhost:8889)

> You can also stop the container with:

```bash
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

This project is configured for **login-free use** of Jupyter Lab — no password or token required.

- ✅ `.env.example` is included with recommended settings.
- 🚫 `.env` is deliberately **excluded** from the repo (add your own if needed).
- 🛡️ You may modify the `docker-compose.yml` to add a token or hashed password later.

---

## 🧠 Recommended Use

- ✍️ Study each notebook sequentially and refer back as needed
- 🧪 Use `/scripts/` functions in other projects or interview tasks
- 🧵 Treat `docs/numpy_cheatsheet.md` as your quick review guide
- 🧠 Use `10_kmeans_from_scratch.ipynb` in your resume to show NumPy fluency
- 💡 Add your own notebooks (e.g., PCA from scratch, numerical integration, etc.)

---
